Given the output of a historial dpkg --get-selections, this program, lists
dpkg --purge suggestions which will get you some way, to returning your
system back to the package state on that historical date.

Example Usage: 
cat historical.get-selections | python get-selections-undo.py 2>/tmp/python.stderr

( See get-selections-undo.cmd for further examples )


get-selections-filter.py:

Functionality similar to

dpkg --get-selections | grep -P '\tinstall'

but with some formatting to generate apt-get commends which 
you can then review and copy / paste.


Notes and Links about grep -P

  When GNU grep is operating in pcre mode (-P) then you can specify non-printing characters such as \t  tab (hex 09)
